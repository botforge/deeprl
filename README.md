Pytorch Implementation of Hw's in the Deep Reinforcement Learning Class @ UC Berkeley taught by Sergey LevineJ

### Hw 1 Imitation Learning
Implemented Behavioural Cloning from an expert policy, along with DAgger to play a number of MuJOCO Simulated games

### Hw 2 Policy Gradient (REINFORCE Algorithm along with state dependent baselines)
Implemented Policy Gradient (REINFORCE Algorithm) along with proofs showing the effect of state dependent baselines on the bias of the policy gradient

### Hw 3 DQN and Actor Critic 
Implemented DQN and Actor Critic and tested various hyper params
